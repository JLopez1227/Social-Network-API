# Social-Network-API

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a functional database with models, routes, controllers, seeded data, using MongoDB and Mongoose. I had to create models for reactions, thoughts, as well as a user. Each of these were done in their respective JavaScript files in the model folder. We also had to set up routes for the user and thought models. These were completed in their respectvie JavaSvript files in the routes folder.
## Getting Started
To use this application you'll first want to clone my GitHub Repository to your local computer. After you've done this you'll want to open the intergrated termial on the `index.js` located outside and underneath the `utils` folder. You'll then want to run `npm i` to install all of the necessary packages, after you run `npm i` you'll then run `npm run seed` to seed all of the data. Finally, you can run `node index.js` to start your server, and you can then open up Insomina and test all of the routes!
